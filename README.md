•	Created a CNN model by Python Pytorch for identifying the smoking behavior in the image. Processed our initial images by auto-cropping and normalization
•	The model contains 4 convolutional layers and maxpooled them after each layer. Improved our model's performance by applying dropouts and batch normalization. Applied Adam optimizer, BCE loss function, and sigmoid activation function.
•	Achieved 99.9% accuracy on training dataset, 87% on validation dataset, and 85% on testing dataset.
